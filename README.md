Home fragment shows all the latest news obtained from newsapi.org, 
the user can swipe right to save the news for a later read, 
swipe left to discard the news. 
It can also be achieved by using the thumb up and thumb down buttons instead of swiping gestures.


Search fragment allows the user to search for news by typing in the keyword.


Save fragment displays all the news that the user has liked/swiped right/thumbed up, 
he/she can also click on the news image tiles to read the details or click on the heart icon to unlike/unsave the news
